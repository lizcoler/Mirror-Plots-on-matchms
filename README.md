# Mirror-Plots-on-matchms
Utilizing the matchms python library, we can compare two spectra from an mgf file. The spectra are compared using a mirror plot.


How to Use
1. Download dependencies by typing 'pip install matchms matplotlib' in your terminal
2. matchms will download pandas and numpy. In some cases, the version you have downloaded is newer than the version that matchms uses. In this case, you can type 'pip install pandas<2.0' and 'pip install numpy<2.0' in your terminal.
3. In the code, change file_path, scan_num_1, and scan_num_2.
4. Run the code - mirror plot should generate at the bottom.
